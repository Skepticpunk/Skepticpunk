Skepticpunk's Github.

Whatever I decide to fuck around with code/configwise and share with people will end up here in some capacity.

Also, I guess I'm using this to host files that are required by other sites (such as the Userstyles.org Archive at https://uso.kkx.one) to be hosted on Github or something similar.
